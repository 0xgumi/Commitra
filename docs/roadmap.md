# Roadmap

This document outlines the **confirmed development direction**
and **research-oriented extensions** of Commitra.

Items are explicitly categorized to avoid ambiguity.

---

## v1.5 (Current)

- End-to-end verifiable voting
- Encrypted ballots with private tally
- On-chain proof verification
- Multi-vote session support
- Product-ready deployment

Status: **Complete**

---

## v2 (Confirmed direction)

The following items are planned and actively designed:

### Threshold decryption
- Replace single coordinator key
- k-of-n distributed key shares
- Partial decryption with on-chain verification

### Scalability
- Support for large voter sets (10,000+)
- Improved aggregation efficiency
- Reduced proof generation overhead

### Automation
- Time-based vote finalization
- Reduced manual intervention

---

## Research & exploratory items

The following are **research directions**, not commitments:

- Cross-chain voting settlement
- Alternative cryptographic constructions
- Advanced privacy-preserving analytics

These items are evaluated based on maturity
and real-world applicability.

---

## Design philosophy

Commitra prioritizes:

- Correctness over novelty
- Verifiability over opacity
- Practical deployment over theoretical completeness

---

## Summary

The roadmap reflects a balance between
engineering certainty and research ambition.

Confirmed items focus on removing remaining trust assumptions,
while exploratory work remains clearly marked as such.
